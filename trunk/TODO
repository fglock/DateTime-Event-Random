TODO list for Perl module DateTime::Event::Random

Organize the TODO list :)

Maybe implement truncate_to => 'days'

How to obtain shuffled datetimes?

How to obtain exactly an event per week?

Find out some links about the "density function"

Implement other random distributions
- implement next/previous instead of "duration"

Optimize new_cached()

Optimize duration()

$set->next($dt) on an unbounded, uncached set should use a different
density value (0.5 density)

Documented problems - from the POD:

Note that, although the datetime values are random,
the accessors (C<as_list>, C<iterator/next/previous>) always 
return sorted datetimes.
